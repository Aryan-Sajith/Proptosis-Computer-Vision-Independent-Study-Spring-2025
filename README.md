# Proptosis Medical Screening Computer Vision Project

This repository hosts the code, datasets, and documentation for the independent study titled **"Leveraging Self-Supervised Learning for Early Medical Screening: A Pilot Study in Proptosis Detection."** The project investigates the use of self-supervised learning techniques to detect subtle facial indicators of proptosis, a potential early sign of systemic diseases such as Thyroid Eye Disease and tumors. The study is organized into two main phases: a proof-of-concept using synthetic or toy datasets, followed by the application of these methods to clinical proptosis screening data (with all necessary ethical approvals and safeguards in place).

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: To assess the effectiveness of self-supervised learning in low-data scenarios and to develop a non-invasive early screening tool for proptosis.
- **Phases**:
  1. **Proof-of-Concept**: Validate the self-supervised approach on a controlled toy dataset (e.g., animal images) to establish baseline performance and robust evaluation metrics.
  2. **Clinical Application**: Fine-tune the model on anonymized clinical images for proptosis detection and compare its performance against supervised baselines.
